ðŸ’¬ Hello, I'm Anthony, I made a career change, where I found a real passion.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on PHP/SYMFONY  
ðŸ‘¯ I have been working in a factory for almost 10 years now.  
ðŸ¤” What do I like about development? Logical problem solving, all the infinite possibilities that this profession offers us. Monitoring continues and discovering new things every day.  
ðŸ“„ You will be able to discover the different small projects that I do to practice on a daily basis, and continue to learn.  
ðŸ¥° I really have a preference for the backend, but I am also impatient to discover all the features that the frontend offers us
