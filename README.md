### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**AnthoNoel/AnthoNoel** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

ðŸ’¬ Hello, I'm Anthony, I'm currently training as a web developer at the O'clock school, where I found a real passion.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on PHP/SYMFONY
- ðŸ‘¯ I have been working in a factory for almost 10 years now.
- ðŸ¤” What do I like about development? Logical problem solving, all the infinite possibilities that this profession offers us. Monitoring continues and discovering new things every day.
- ðŸ“„ You will be able to discover the different small projects that I do to practice on a daily basis, and continue to learn.
- ðŸ¥° I really have a preference for the backend, but I am also impatient to discover all the features that the frontend offers us
